Railgen
=======
This is a script for generating an HTML listing of a rail network in a
Minecraft world. How to use it:

1. Install Markaby with ``gem install markaby``.
2. Add your rail data to a ``.yaml`` file. See the ``pve-6-rails.yaml`` file
   for an example.
3. Run ``ruby railgen.rb DATA_FILE HTML_FILE`` to create a HTML file.
4. The HTML file will include a stylesheet reference to ``rail-style.css``,
   so you can use that to make it look nice.

Right now it's all static text, but if I find someone who is *really* skilled
in the arts of graphical programming, I may be able to add a map generator
in the future.
